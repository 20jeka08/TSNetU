Overview
---------

A number of commercial softwares for transient simulation in water
distribution systems are available in the market; however, he use of
these softwares for research purposes is limited. The major restriction is
due to the fact that the softwares are packed as black boxes and the source
code is not visible, thus prohibiting any changes, including modification of
existing and implementation of new elements in the source code.
Therefore, the authors find it imperative to develop an open source package
rendering easiness for interaction, modification, and extension.


Features
--------

The WMOC is a Pyton package designed to perform transient simulation in water
distribution networks. The software includes capability to:

* Generate water network models based on .inp files 
* Operate elements, including pumps and valves, to generate transient events
* Add disruptive events including pipe bursts and leakages
* Perform transient simulation using MOC method
* Visulize results
